|| Result example: <Patient> Hello Dr. Y, I saw the results of my kidney function test in MyChart. It looks like my creatinine level is high. What does that mean? <Doctor> Hi [Patient's Name], a high creatinine level could indicate that your kidneys are not functioning as well as they should. It's important to note that one test result may not tell the whole story, and other factors, such as your age, sex, and muscle mass, can affect the creatinine level. Let's schedule an appointment to go over your results in more detail and determine if any further testing or treatment is needed. ||
|| Result example: <Patient> I received my liver function test results on MyChart and noticed my AST level is near the upper level of the normal range. What should I do? <Doctor> Hello, I see that your AST level is at the upper end of normal. AST is an enzyme found mainly in the liver. It's important to remember that many factors can affect liver enzyme levels, and yours are still within the normal range and doesn't mean there is a problem. Let's discuss further at your next appointment and we may decide to repeat them again to see how they trend.||
|| Result example: <Patient> Dr. E, I had a biopsy done on a mole last week, and I just saw the results in MyChart. It says "benign melanocytic nevus." Can you explain what this means? <Doctor> Hello, I'm glad you reached out. A "benign melanocytic nevus" is a technical term for a common mole. The word "benign" indicates that it is not cancerous. This is good news, and it means that the mole is not harmful. However, it's important to keep an eye on your skin and report any changes in your moles, such as shape, size, or color. Regular skin checks are a good practice.||
|| Result example: <Patient> I just saw my cholesterol test results on MyChart, and the numbers seem to be within the normal range. Does this mean I don't have to worry about my heart health? <Doctor> Hi, it's great to see your cholesterol levels within the normal range, as this reduces your risk of heart disease. However, it's still important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking. These measures can help keep your cholesterol in check and support overall heart health. If you have any questions or would like further guidance, please don't hesitate to schedule an appointment. ||
|| Result example: <Patient> Hi, Dr. D. I received my blood glucose test results on MyChart, and they are slightly elevated. What does this mean, and should I be concerned? <Doctor> Hello, slightly elevated blood glucose levels can be due to a variety of factors, including diet, stress, or even the time of day the test was taken. It's not necessarily a cause for concern, but it's something to keep an eye on. I recommend making some healthy lifestyle changes, such as eating balanced meals, getting regular exercise, and managing stress. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your results, any potential risk factors, and a plan to monitor your blood glucose levels going forward. ||
|| Result example: <Patient> Dr. I, my colon biopsy results just came in, and it mentions "tubular adenoma." What does this mean? <Doctor> Hello, a tubular adenoma is a type of polyp found in the colon. While it's not cancerous, it's considered a precancerous lesion, meaning it has the potential to turn into cancer over time. The good news is that by removing these polyps, we can significantly reduce your risk of developing colon cancer. We should continue your colon cancer screening as it is a proven method to prevent any polyps from progressing to something more serious. So nothing to worry about and we will continue with your regular colonoscopy screening intervals. ||
