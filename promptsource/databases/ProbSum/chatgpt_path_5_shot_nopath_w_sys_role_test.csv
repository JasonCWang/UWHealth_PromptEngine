Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart failure; Anemia; Thrombocytopenia; Chronic atrial fibrillation; Chronic renal failure; ,"Diagnoses: Acute Kidney Injury; Stage IV CKD; Anemia; Hypotension.
<Reasoning> The patient's history of HTN, CHF, AFib, mild AS, and Stage IV CKD put him at high risk for complications related to kidney function. The drop in HCT and elevated creatinine suggest acute kidney injury, which could be contributing to the patient's lethargy and hypotension. The persistently hypotensive state despite fluid boluses and the need for a PICC line for pressors suggests that the patient is at high risk for hypotension-related complications. Additionally, the patient's anemia could be contributing to his lethargy and requires further investigation."

DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA); Tachycardia; ,"Diagnoses: DKA; Tachycardia; Nausea/vomiting
<Reasoning> The patient was admitted with DKA, which is a direct diagnosis based on the initial presentation. The persistent tachycardia can be explained by the stress of hospitalization, as well as the initial metabolic derangements that led to DKA. The recurrent nausea and vomiting can be attributed to the residual effects of DKA or side effects of the treatment regimen."

Direct Differential Diagnoses:
1. CNS VRE
2. LEUKOCYTOSIS
3. ALL

Reasoning: The patient has a history of CNS involvement with VRE contamination and SDH evacuation. The patient is currently afebrile and WBC count is trending downwards, which could suggest an improvement in CNS VRE. Leukocytosis is also present, which may be indicative of an underlying infection. The patient has a history of ALL, which may be contributing to the leukocytosis.

Hypoxic Respiratory failure; ARDS; VAP; VAP; Shock; ,"Example 1: 
Diagnoses: CNS VRE; LEUKOCYTOSIS; ALL
<Reasoning>: Based on the patient's past medical history and current presentation, the most likely direct diagnosis is CNS VRE. The patient had a history of recurrent ALL with CNS involvement and had a previous Omaya removal due to VRE contamination. The presence of leukocytosis also supports this diagnosis. The next likely direct diagnosis is leukocytosis, which is likely related to the patient's underlying infection. The third likely direct diagnosis is ALL, which is the patient's underlying medical condition and is likely contributing to the patient's current presentation.

Bacterial Endocarditis; ESRD on HD; HIV; Anemia; Thrombocytopenia; ,"Diagnoses: Bacterial endocarditis; Febrile illness; HIV/AIDS. 

<Reasoning> The patient's history of endocarditis, fevers, and positive blood cultures strongly suggest a diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis. The patient's HIV/AIDS status increases their risk for this infection. The diarrhea and nausea/vomiting may be related to the underlying infection or the patient's ESRD and require further evaluation."

<Reasoning> 
The patient has a history of CAD, systolic/diastolic CHF with EF 40%, and CKD. The presenting complaint is acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema, which could be related to the worsening CHF. The patient received 200mg IV lasix over 24 hours with net -700cc and UOP 1.6L. The upright CXR revealed decreased interstitial edema and decreased pleural effusions with no infiltrate, which supports the diagnosis of flash pulmonary edema.

<Reasoning>
The patient has a significant medical history of CAD, systolic CHF, mechanical AVR, DM2, HTN, h/o UTI and CoNS bacteremia. The patient recently underwent small bowel resection and primary anastomosis. The patient is now admitted to the MICU with hypotension and low-grade temps. Given the history and current presentation, the top differential diagnosis would be hypotension with sepsis. The recent small bowel resection can lead to a postoperative ileus, which can cause fever and a slow recovery. The ischemic bowel can also contribute to the development of seps"
Pneumonia; Hypotension; Diabetes; Leukocytosis; ESRD; Coronary artery disease; ,"Diagnoses: Hypotension; Pneumonia; Pulmonary Embolism; ESRD on PD; DM2 

<Reasoning> Hypotension and pneumonia are direct diagnoses based on the initial presentation and admission diagnosis. Pulmonary embolism is an indirect diagnosis because it was found incidentally while evaluating the patient for hypotension. ESRD on PD and DM2 are indirect diagnoses based on the patient's medical history."
ARF; Sepsis; pna; Peritonitis; CHF; Anemia; Hepatitis C Cirrhosis; Thrombocytopenia; ,"Diagnoses: Peritonitis; Cholecystitis; Hepatic Encephalopathy; Cirrhosis; Hyperkalemia

<Reasoning>
The patient's history of cirrhosis and esophageal varices, combined with diffuse abdominal pain and peritonitis, suggests that there is a hepatic cause for the patient's current condition. The CT scan also reveals extensive ascites and a massively distended gallbladder, which could suggest cholecystitis. Additionally, the patient's history of ESRD on hemodialysis and use of lactulose and midodrine suggest hepatic encephalopathy as a possibility. The patient's hyperkalemia and need for CVVH further support the possibility of hepatic dysfunction."
"DOE/hypoxia: Likely multifactorial with CHF, COPD, possible LLL
   infiltrate; AS; Afib; Hypotension; ","Diagnoses: Critical aortic stenosis; CHF exacerbation; COPD exacerbation

<Reasoning>
The patient's presentation with DOE/SOB, hypoxia, and LLL infiltrate strongly suggests exacerbation of COPD and CHF. However, the critical aortic stenosis and transient hypotension are also concerning and could be contributing factors to the patient's symptoms. These three differential diagnoses should be considered and further evaluated in the CCU."
Hypoxic respiratory failure; ARDS; pneumonia; sepsis; DM; HTN; Asthma; ,"Diagnoses: Hypoxemic respiratory failure; Post-operative wound infection; Hypertensive emergency.

<Reasoning> In the first example, the patient has CNS VRE, leukocytosis, and recurrent ALL. The leukocytosis may be related to ALL, but other possibilities such as CNS infection should be considered. In the second example, the patient has a history of intermittent post-op hypotension, infiltrate on CXR, thrombocytopenia, and cryptogenic cirrhosis c/b variceal bleed, which may be the underlying cause of hypotension.

<Reasoning> The patient has a history of Afib with RVR, and is currently in Afib with fast rate despite several attempts to control the rate with medications. The patient also has acute diastolic heart failure and flash pulmonary edema, which may be contributing to the hypotension and fluid overload seen in the patient."
Hypoxia:  Pt with evidence of volume overload; mucus plugging; Delirium; C. diff colitis; ,"Diagnoses: Altered mental status; Tachycardia with episodes of bradycardia; C. diff colitis

<Reasoning>
The patient's altered mental status and tachycardia with episodes of bradycardia could be due to a variety of reasons, such as infection, medication side effects, or underlying medical conditions. Given the patient's history of C. diff colitis, this could be a contributing factor. Additionally, the patient's chronic pain and poor nutritional status on TPN may also be playing a role. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm or rule out these potential causes.

In summary, the top three direct and indirect differential diagnoses for each example are:
Example 1:
Direct: CNS VRE; LEUKOC"
"Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology; Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload; AIDS; myopericarditis; ","Diagnoses: Pericardial tamponade; Febrile illness with tachycardia; Advanced AIDS

<Reasoning>
The patient's history of advanced AIDS with a severely low CD4 count puts him at risk for opportunistic infections and associated complications. The worsening sternal chest pain and fevers with shaking chills suggest a febrile illness. The rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention. The patient's sinus tachycardia and hypoxia also indicate significant cardiopulmonary compromise. The AFB (-) x 3 and negative cultures suggest that the patient's condition may not be due to an infectious etiology, but rather to his underlying immunocompromised state."
"Multifactorial shock

   likely sources being nonhealing skin wounds and pneumonia; Acute on chronic renal failure; Thrombocytopenia; Anemia; PVD with bilateral LE cellulitis/ulcers; DM; Afib; DVT; ","Diagnoses: Beta streptococcal bacteremia; Septic shock; Acute kidney injury (ATN)

<Reasoning> The patient presents with beta streptococcal bacteremia, which is a serious bacterial infection that can lead to sepsis and septic shock. This is supported by the patient's chief complaint of respiratory failure and shock. The patient's underlying conditions, including DM, PVD, and chronic nonhealing LE ulcers, also put him at high risk for sepsis. Septic shock can lead to acute kidney injury, which is evident from the patient's history of ATN requiring hemodialysis."
Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: H/o subglottic stenosis; PNA; CAD; CHF/Cardiomyopathy; Afib/CVA; DM; ,"Diagnoses: Subglottic stenosis; CHF exacerbation; Multi-focal pneumonia. 

<Reasoning>
Subglottic stenosis is a known complication of multiple intubations and can cause respiratory distress, which is consistent with the patient's presentation of shortness of breath and stridor. CHF exacerbation is supported by the patient's low EF and presence of fluid collection in the anterior neck, which is likely due to pulmonary edema. Multi-focal pneumonia is a common complication in patients with CHF and can cause respiratory symptoms as well."
Hypotension; Anemia: Pt with drop in hct s/p debulking of necrotic mets; Ovarian Cancer; ,"Diagnoses: Postoperative respiratory failure; Bowel obstruction; Ovarian cancer
<Reasoning> The patient's chief complaint of respiratory failure suggests a primary diagnosis of postoperative respiratory failure. Additionally, the patient's recent surgery for bowel obstruction and newly diagnosed ovarian cancer are potential contributing factors. The patient's history of intubation and use of sedation also support this diagnosis. Bowel obstruction and ovarian cancer are indirect differential diagnoses, as they could contribute to the patient's respiratory failure."
"Pericardial effusion: Possible etiologies include malignant (given
   history of pancreatic CA), infectious (viral vs. TB), or idiopathic; Anemia; Pancreatic cancer; ","Diagnoses: Pericardial effusion with tamponade; Acute renal failure; Hemolysis

<Reasoning>

Sepsis; Pneumonia; Atrial fibrillation with RVR; Hypernatremia; Hypokalemia; ,"Diagnoses: LLL pneumonia; Sepsis; Respiratory failure

<Reasoning>
For example 1, the direct diagnoses include CNS VRE, LEUKOCYTOSIS, and ALL. The patient's recent surgery for SDH evacuation and Omaya removal due to VRE contamination suggests the presence of CNS VRE. The decreasing trend of WBC count indicates leukocytosis which may be due to the underlying condition of ALL. 

For example 2, the direct diagnoses include intermittent, post-op hypotension, infiltrate on CXR, thrombocytopenia, cryptogenic cirrhosis c/b variceal bleed, and DM2. The patient's previous medical history suggests the presence of these conditions. The hypotension could be due to"
"VT; Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver; acute renal failure; hypernatremia; ","Diagnoses: VT storm; Chronic ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy; Ventricular bigeminy 

<Reasoning> The patient presents with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 20%, and an ICD placement, which puts him at high risk of developing VT storms. The presence of VT storm is supported by the documentation in the note. The ventricular bigeminy observed on telemetry is also concerning and may indicate further arrhythmia issues. These conditions need to be monitored closely and managed to prevent further adverse events."
Hypoxic respiratory failure: Etiology ARDS [**1-13**] flu.; R ankle fracture s/p ORIF; ,"For Example 1:
Diagnoses: CNS VRE; LEUKOCYTOSIS; ALL
<Reasoning>: The patient has a history of ALL with CNS involvement, and is currently recovering after undergoing Omaya removal due to VRE contamination and SDH evacuation. The patient is afebrile and trending downwards on WBC count, which suggests a resolving CNS VRE infection. However, the patient also has leukocytosis, which could indicate a systemic infection or a relapse of ALL. Therefore, CNS VRE, leukocytosis, and ALL are the most likely differential diagnoses. The list of drug allergies and adverse reactions provided can help guide appropriate treatment and avoid adverse reactions.

respiratory failure; Septic shock; ,"Diagnoses: Cholangitis; Respiratory failure; Septic shock

<Reasoning>
Cholangitis is a likely direct differential diagnosis given the patient's history of choledocholithiasis and recent ERCP with stenting. Respiratory failure is another direct diagnosis as the patient is presenting with dyspnea and vomiting, and their course is complicated by respiratory distress. Septic shock is also a direct diagnosis based on the patient's presentation and septic workup. Other potential indirect diagnoses could include dementia and renal cancer, both of which could have contributed to the patient's presentation and medical history."

The CXR showing retrocardiac opacity with decreased O2 saturations further suggests aspiration pneumonia as a secondary differential diagnosis. The rise in CK and trop levels suggest a possible acute renal failure and the rising LFTs suggest a possibility of shock liver. TTE suboptimal EF still 25% c/w multivessel CAD, 2+ MR, and rising PA systolic HTN suggest a diagnosis of multivessel CAD with MR and"
"Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive PNA, PTX, and underlying
   lung disease (COPD); Afib; Hypotension; sepsis; Pneumothorax; Small Cell Lung CA; ","Diagnoses: Hypotension requiring pressors; Post-obstructive pneumonia; CAD. 

<Reasoning> The patient has a history of CAD and COPD, which makes them susceptible to developing post-obstructive pneumonia. They are now hypotensive and require pressors, suggesting sepsis as a possible cause of their hypotension. Additionally, the patient has a history of radiation therapy, which can cause damage to the heart leading to CAD."
Sepsis; C. diff; Adrenal insufficiency; Hypothyroidsm; ,"Diagnoses: # Necrotic colon s/p colectomy with ileostomy and GJ tube placement; C. diff colitis; Hypotension

<Reasoning> 
The patient's recent surgical history, including necrotic colon and GJ tube placement, increases the likelihood of infection or inflammation as a cause of her symptoms, with C. diff colitis being a potential culprit. The patient's hypotension is also a concerning finding and may be due to sepsis or fluid/electrolyte imbalances related to her hyponatremia."

Direct Differential Diagnoses: CNS VRE infection; Leukocytosis; ALL
Indirect Differential Diagnoses: Sepsis; Complications from VRE and SDH removal; Drug Reaction

<Reasoning>
The patient has a history of recurrent ALL with CNS involvement and has undergone Omaya removal due to VRE contamination. The leukocytosis is likely related to their underlying malignancy. CNS VRE infection is a potential complication of the procedure and could be responsible for the continued fever. The rash and nausea/vomiting may be a drug reaction, possibly related to antibiotics.

aspiration pneumonia; CHF and new MR; R hip bleed.; CAD; hip surgery; ,"Diagnoses: STEMI with new MR; VAP; R hip bleed

<Reasoning>
This patient has a complex medical history, and multiple complications from recent hip surgery and STEMI with new MR. Given his history of VAP and R hip bleed, these are likely ongoing concerns that require monitoring and management. The subjective note indicates that the patient is medically stable but has no complaints. The events from the last 24 hours suggest that there have been adjustments made to his nutrition and fluid balance, with the use of IV lasix."
"Most likely etiology is acute pulmonary edema although
   exacerbation of her underlying COPD may also be worsening; Acute Renal Failure; Coronary Artery Disease s/p CABG; Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure; Atrial Fibrillation; ","Diagnoses: Respiratory distress; Lower extremity weakness/falls; COPD exacerbation. 

<Reasoning>: The patient's chief complaint of respiratory distress suggests a primary diagnosis of a respiratory issue. Given her history of COPD, this is likely an exacerbation. The history of lower extremity weakness and falls suggest a potential neurological issue contributing to her respiratory distress. The history of congestive heart failure and EKG should also be considered in the differential diagnosis."
Sepsis; source to be tunnelled catheter line; MSSA; Back Pain; ESRD; Non-Ichemic CMY; Seizure d.o.; ,"Diagnoses: GPC sepsis; Hypotension; HD dependent ESRD

<Reasoning> The patient presents with a history of HD dependent ESRD, CAD, and non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) with a recent history of malaise. The patient was transferred from the floor with suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension responsive to IVF. The patient has no known drug allergies. Therefore, the top three direct and indirect differential diagnoses could be GPC sepsis, hypotension, and HD dependent ESRD."
Pericardial effusion; Breast Cancer; ,"For Example 1:
Direct differential diagnoses:
1. CNS VRE
2. Leukocytosis
3. ALL

Indirect differential diagnoses:
1. Drug reaction - rash, hives, wheezing
2. Darvon induced nausea and vomiting
3. Percodan induced nausea and vomiting

<Reasoning>: The patient's medical history suggests a diagnosis of recurrent ALL with CNS involvement. The presence of leukocytosis is also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient has a history of VRE infection, which could have caused CNS involvement. The patient has also experienced drug reactions to various medications such as sulfa, penicillin, and red dye. The patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting can be attributed to Darvon and Percodan use.

<Reasoning>
Direct diagnoses for this patient include respiratory failure and subcutaneous emphysema, which were identified in the input note. The patient's persistent tracheocutaneous air leak likely led to subcutaneous emphysema, which can cause respiratory distress. Additionally, the patient's recent tracheostomy closure could have contributed to the respiratory failure. Tracheal stenosis is a possible indirect differential diagnosis, as it can occur as a complication of tracheostomy closure."
Resp distress; recurrent asp pna/pneumonitis; sepsis; Leukocytosis; ,"Diagnoses: Hypotension; Respiratory distress; Leukocytosis; C4-5 paraplegia with TF dependence; Recent pneumonia; Broad spectrum antibiotics

<Reasoning>
1. Hypotension: The patient has a history of HOTN and is on broad spectrum antibiotics for recent pneumonia. The patient also required IVF to respond to the hypotension. There may be underlying sepsis or a medication-induced cause.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient was transferred from OSH with respiratory distress and leukocytosis. The patient's history of C4-5 paraplegia with TF dependence suggests potential respiratory muscle weakness or dysfunction that could contribute to respiratory distress.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient was transferred with leukocyt"

   infection; CAD; diastolic dysfunction; afib; Hypertension; ","Example 1:
Diagnoses: CNS VRE; LEUKOCYTOSIS; ALL
<Reasoning> The patient's medical history and current symptoms suggest that the main direct differential diagnosis is CNS VRE infection, as the patient has a history of recurrent ALL with CNS involvement, s/p Omaya removal due to VRE contamination & SDH evacuation. The patient's leukocytosis could be explained by an infectious etiology, such as VRE, and/or from her underlying leukemia. Additionally, ALL is a significant indirect differential diagnosis, as the patient has a history of recurrent disease and is presenting with leukocytosis.

<Reasoning>
The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events, which are indicative of cardiogenic shock. The critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 is also concerning and can contribute to cardiogenic shock. The patient also has a history of CAD which increases the likelihood of developing cardiogenic shock. The patient's symptoms indicate the need for urgent aortic valve replacement."
