An 86 yo man with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and

   of chronic systolic congestive heart failure. <Subjective> TITLE: Chief Complaint: 24 Hour Events:  He continues to require 4L NC O2 and cool mist face tent at 50% FiO2.  Tried to wean O2 down to 2L NC and patient desatted to 90%, patient also desatted to 89% when face tent weaning was attempted.  Lactate decreasing from 2.6 to 2.3, patient afebrile. Patient put out about 2 Liters of urine in response to Lasix 40mg IV.  Creatinine bumped to 1.3 from 1.2 on PM lytes.  Needs further diuresis, but patient does not want a Foley catheter, so will re-dose Lasix 40mg IV in the AM.  Received vanco and levofloxacin IV in ER, but discontinued on the floor.  Abx may need to be restarted pending CXR, WBC count, and clinical exam.  Currently clinical exam is not indicative of PNA.  Digoxin level is subtherapeutic at 0.4 and digoxin dosing increased to 125mcg daily from 125mcg 3x/wk (monitor levels). Metoprolol dosing increased from 50mg daily to 50mg  for better rate control. This morning the patient reports that his cough has improved and he was able to sleep well in bed with 2 pillows like he does at home. Allergies: No Known Drug Allergies

Pt was noted to be tremulous, anxious appearing, and then appeared as if he was going to vomit but did not. Pt sent for CTA chest/pelvis, ordered for troponins, lactate noted to rise to 6.0. Pt noted to have no oral temp, but rectal temp to 104. -- Had CTA of abd/pelvis, concerning for caudate liver mass, w/ invasion to IVC. Final read pending. - Pt hypotensive upon return to floor w/ SBP 70s-80s, giving boluses fluids - surgery consulted, no intervention tonight, and unlikely given Pt's age.

Declined thoracentesis, will try for extubation. Patient is still ok to intubated. - RSBI 60s, SBT -> minimal retention, no change in oxygenation.  Was going to attempt extubation but patient minimally responsive with no gag so deferred until AM. Stopped drip sedation, converted to bolus and placed on PSV. - Tachy to 150s, levophed requirement going up. Patient given 500, 250, bolus with minimal effect.  Vagal maneuvers dropped BP but not HR. Given additional 1000 cc IVF and neo started with goal to wean levophed.  Once off levophed, HR dropped to 80s with BP steady (90-100/50s) Allergies: No Known Drug Allergies

If continued drainage, consider pericardial window. - renal recs: Sediment:  RBC per hpf with few dysmorphic RBCs particularly few acanthyocytes, 0-2 WBC per hpf, numerous hyaline casts of note, several granular casts (no muddy browns), no RBC casts, no crystals; recommended for glomerulonephritis serologies (sent); they did not think this was HUS-TTP - heme onc recs: less likely TTP-HUS given that platelets are not low. Hemolysis could be secondary to chemotherapy versus recurrence of malignancy; recommended staging CT torso,  hemolysis labs, repeat coombs, G6PD,  body prep Echo: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. CT torso: Increased (R > L) pleural effusions and associated atelectasis. Decreased pericardial effusion after pericardial catheter placement. Eval for lymphadenopathy limited w/o IV contrast. At least one likely new pulmonary nodule, recommend followup by CT and if possible w/ IV contrast. Did not order given renal failure. Allergies: No Known Drug Allergies

Her platelets came back at 13 and she was given a unit of platelets. She had a trans-labial U/S which showed no fluid collection so OB/GYN deferred management. ID was consulted & they recommended meropenum and vanco. Labial cellulitis was examened last night showing worsening of infection (spread beyond marked borders) and some peri-rectal skin breakdown. Cards made recommendations re: long term management -- metoprolol, lisinopril and ASA when condition improves.  patient was started on atorvastatin per recs.

Now with known gram negative bacteremia but impressive improvement and ability to be weaned off pressors in less than 24 hours. 24 Hour Events:  -Initially was on three pressors but weaned off over the course of the day with preservation of MAP's >65 -Blood cultures with GNR's, caspofungin discontinued (OK w/ hematology and oncology) -Echo showed new LV dysfunction with LVEF 20% per echo (new since ) -Had hematochezia and AM Hct 24 and Plt 9.  Ordered for one unit of blood and one unit platelets. ________________________________  -remains off pressors with stable BP -had multiple episodes bloody diarrhea (marroon, liquidy but not quantified) during the day. per BMT, consider Plt goal >30, Hct goal >25 -Changed PPI to IV pantoprazole  -Stool culture and C diff sent- considering Shigella or other entero-invasive bacteria causing both bloody diarrhea and bacteremia. -GNR from admission blood cx () are pan sensitive but not yet speciated. On cefepime, gent, vanco -Low UOP to 40cc/ 3 hrs in evening but CVP 14. Pt getting a lot of blood products and abx during the day although having diarrhea. Deferred giving more fluids for now -Got 2 units plt with plt 9-32 but with 1 u PRBCS Hct only from 24.4- 24.7. Getting 2nd unit prbcs in evening and will rechk Hct, Plt and coags. Premedicating before products with tylenol and benadryl so may be missing a fever today with these meds. -PM gent trough 2.7. Pharmacy states her trough goal is <2. Adjusted dose to 100 q8. Ordered level for tomorrow as well as vanco level for am. -Consider calling GI in am re: possible scope if bloody diarrhea persists. Allergies: Morphine Pruritis;

Feels breathing is the same as yesterday 24 Hour Events: - Nutrition consulted and suggested increasing TFs to cycle 120ml/hr for 18 hours per day, then off at night to prevent hunger but since not eating decided no need to cycle so just increased goal to 120ml/hr with increased free water boluses as sodium slightly high. - Was 300mL positive at ~4pm so got 40mg IV lasix to keep more even in setting of increasing the tube feeds and put out >600mL but then was still positive (they werent adding in the 100mL free water flushes Q6H) so gave another 40mg IV lasix.
