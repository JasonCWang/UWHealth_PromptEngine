# 082_UWHealth_LLM_Prompt_Engineering

## Background (Directly from PromptSource)

PromptSource is a toolkit for creating, sharing and using natural language prompts. Recent work has shown that large language models exhibit the ability to perform reasonable zero-shot generalization to new tasks. For instance, [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) demonstrated that large language models have strong zero- and few-shot abilities. [FLAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01652) and [T0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207) then demonstrated that pre-trained language models fine-tuned in a massively multitask fashion yield even stronger zero-shot performance. A common denominator in these works is the use of prompts which has gained interest among NLP researchers and engineers. This emphasizes the need for new tools to create, share and use natural language prompts.

PromptSource provides the tools to create, and share natural language prompts, and then use the thousands of existing and newly created prompts through a simple API. Prompts are saved in standalone structured files and are written in a simple templating language called Jinja.

## Setting up promptsource for Clinical Usecase
If you do not intend to create new prompts, you can simply run:
1. Download the repo
1. Navigate to the root directory of the repo
1. Run `pip install -e .`
Note: NEED Python < 3.9
